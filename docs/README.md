Example: `todo read book | chapter 1`

```
Got it! I've added this task:
[T][ ] read book <chapter 1>
Now you have 1 task in the list.
Keep soaring -- your tasks won't complete themselves!
```

## Adding deadlines

You can add a task with a specific due date using the `deadline` command.  
The description cannot be empty, and the date must be in `yyyy-MM-dd` format.
